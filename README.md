## Requirements

* Laravel Framework >=9.0
* PHP 8.1 or higher
* Database (eg: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
* Web Server (eg: Apache, Nginx, IIS)
* URL Rewrite (eg: mod_rewrite for Apache)

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require inovector/mixpost
```

Publish the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="mixpost-migrations"
```

Mixpost uses [Job Batching](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/queues#job-batching) and you should create a database migration to build a table to contain meta information about your job batches.

If your application does not yet have this table, it may be generated using the:
```bash
php artisan queue:batches-table
```

Run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="mixpost-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    /*
     * Credentials for third-party services
     */
    'credentials' => [
        'twitter' => [
            'client_id' => env('MIXPOST_TWITTER_CLIENT_ID'),
            'client_secret' => env('MIXPOST_TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET'),
            'redirect' => env('MIXPOST_TWITTER_REDIRECT', 'http://localhost/mixpost/callback/twitter')
        ],
    ],

    /*
     * Setting options for each social network
     * We recommend leaving these options unchanged
     * You only change them when the API policy of the social networks changes, and you know what you are doing.
     */
    'social_provider_options' => [
        'twitter' => [
            'simultaneous_posting_on_multiple_accounts' => false,
            'post_characters_limit' => 280
        ],
        'facebook' => [
            'simultaneous_posting_on_multiple_accounts' => true,
            'post_characters_limit' => null
        ]
    ],

    /**
     * Mixpost will redirect unauthorized users to the route specified here
     */
    'redirect_unauthorized_users_to_route' => 'login',

    /*
     * The disk on which to store added files.
     * Choose one or more of the disks you've configured in config/filesystems.php.
     */
    'disk' => env('MIXPOST_DISK', 'public'),

    /*
     * The maximum file size of an item in bytes.
     * Adding a larger file will result in an exception.
     */
    'max_file_size' => 1024 * 1024 * 200, // 200MB

    /**
     * Accepted mime types for media library upload.
     * These are all supported mime types for the media files. We do not guarantee that it will work with other types.
     * If you need to remove certain mime types, you are free to do so from here.
     */
    'mime_types' => [
        'image/jpg',
        'image/jpeg',
        'image/gif',
        'image/png',
        'video/mp4',
        'video/quicktime'
    ],

    /*
     * The path where to store temporary files while performing image conversions.
     * If set to null, storage_path('mixpost-media/temp') will be used.
     */
    'temporary_directory_path' => null,

    /*
     * FFMPEG & FFProbe binaries paths, only used if you try to generate video thumbnails
     */
    'ffmpeg_path' => env('FFMPEG_PATH', '/usr/bin/ffmpeg'),
    'ffprobe_path' => env('FFPROBE_PATH', '/usr/bin/ffprobe'),

    /**
     * Define cache prefix
     */
    'cache_prefix' => env('MIXPOST_CACHE_PREFIX', 'mixpost')
];
```

Publish the assets:

```bash
php artisan mixpost:publish-assets
```
Mixpost has the ability to generate images from video while uploading a video file. This would not be possible without FFmpeg installed on your server.
You need to follow FFmpeg installation instructions on their [official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

After installation, depending on the operating system, you need to set the `ffmpeg_path` and `ffprobe_path` in the Mixpost config file.

Default folder path: `/usr/bin/`. If FFmpeg is there, there is no need to change it.

```php
/*
 * FFMPEG & FFProbe binaries paths, only used if you try to generate video thumbnails
 */
'ffmpeg_path' => env('FFMPEG_PATH', '/usr/bin/ffmpeg'),
'ffprobe_path' => env('FFPROBE_PATH', '/usr/bin/ffprobe'),
```

## Queue configuration

Set `QUEUE_CONNECTION` in your .env file to your preferred queue connection. We recommend `redis` connection.

Don't forget running the queue worker `php artisan queue:work`. In production, you need a way to keep your `queue:work` processes running. 

For this reason, you need to configure a process monitor that can detect when your `queue:work` processes exit and automatically restart them. Supervisor is a process monitor, follow [their installation instructions](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/queues#supervisor-configuration).

## Schedule the commands

In the console kernel (`app/Console/Kernel.php`), you should schedule this command.

```php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    // ...
    $schedule->command('mixpost:run-scheduled-posts')->everyMinute();
}
```

Don't forget to add a cron that running the scheduler:

`* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`


## Add authorization to Mixpost UI

Mixpost does not come with any user management, we assume that you already provide this in your own app. You can use a gate check to determine who can access Mixpost.

You can determine which users of your application are allowed to view the Mixpost UI by defining a gate check called viewMixpost in your `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` file.

```php
public function boot()
{
    \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Gate::define('viewMixpost', function ($user = null) {
        return optional($user)->email === 'dima@inovector.com';
    });
}
```

Mixpost will redirect unauthorized users to the route specified in the `redirect_unauthorized_users_to_route` key of the Mixpost config file.

## Visit the UI

After performing all these steps, you should be able to visit the Mixpost UI at /mixpost.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
